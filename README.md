# So what is HTML, CSS, and Javascript? 
HTML is the structure, CSS is the styling, and JavaScript is the behavior.

HTML
  - HTML is where you define the structural parts of the website. Like: 'There will be an image on this page, a title, a description, an input form, a link.'
    - *Show in real time as I edit an HTML file, add images, links, titles, etc...*

CSS
  - CSS is where you define the styling of the website. So things like: 'I want the background color to be beige, the font to be Roboto, the title to be bold, everything centered'
  - *Show in real time as I edit an HTML file, add images, links, titles, etc...*

JS
  - Javascript is where you define the behaviors and functionality of the website. This could range from very simple functionality such as: 'I want the image to change when a visitor click on it' to 'As soon as this webpage loads, I want the visitor's browser to start mining bitcoin for me'.
