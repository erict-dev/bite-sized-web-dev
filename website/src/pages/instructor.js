          <p>Compared to boot camps which are extremely cost prohibitive and high commitment,
costing tens of thousands of dollars over the course of a dozen weeks.
We teach the same material for magnitudes less because we are not profit driven, 
we just love to teach. We make enough to cover the 
cost of renting a space and for the time of our instructors.
Donâ€™t believe us? Try your first class for 25% off.</p>
